### Welcome to Chapter 10: The Data Project - Prototyping Projects in Streamlit

This folder contains the files for the Goodreads demo application, which shows us how to make an end to end project in Streamlit. It uses some of the libraries held in the requirements.txt file within the [central book folder](https://github.com/tylerjrichards/Getting-Started-with-Streamlit-for-Data-Science/blob/main/requirements.txt). Download these libraries using [pip](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pip-install-requirements/) before getting started here!  
If you think there is a problem with this code, please [open an issue or pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) or just find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/tylerjrichards) and DM me!
